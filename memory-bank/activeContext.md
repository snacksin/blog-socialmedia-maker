# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- **Project Initialization**: Setting up the foundational project structure and documentation
- **Requirements Gathering**: Defining the core requirements and constraints for the Blog to Social Media tool
- **System Architecture**: Establishing the initial technical architecture and component relationships

## Recent Changes
- Created Memory Bank with core documentation files
- Defined initial project scope and requirements
- Outlined system architecture and component relationships
- Established technology stack and technical constraints

## Active Decisions
- **Platform Priority**: Determining which social media platforms to support first
- **Frontend Implementation**: Deciding between a web-based tool or a desktop application
- **Content Analysis Approach**: Evaluating options for extracting key points from blog content
- **MVP Scope**: Defining the minimum viable product features to prioritize

## Current Considerations
- How to effectively balance automation with user control over transformed content
- How to handle different content types (text-heavy vs. image-heavy blogs)
- Whether to focus on API integrations or manual export workflows first
- How to measure and validate content transformation quality

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Create a simple prototype of the content transformation engine
2. Develop platform-specific transformation rules for Twitter and LinkedIn
3. Build a basic user interface for content input and preview
4. Implement content analysis to identify key themes and messages
5. Create a testing framework for validating transformation quality

## Open Questions
- What metrics should we use to measure successful content transformation?
- How much customization should users have over platform-specific transformations?
- Should we prioritize direct API integration or focus on content preparation first?
- How should we handle image content and attribution across platforms?
