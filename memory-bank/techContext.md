# Technical Context

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript**: Core web technologies for the user interface
- **React**: Frontend framework for building the user interface components
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Draft.js**: Rich text editor framework for handling blog content input
- **React Router**: For client-side routing

### Backend
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for the backend server
- **Express**: Web framework for building the API
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user data, templates, and configurations

### APIs & Integrations
- **Twitter API**: For posting content to Twitter/X
- **LinkedIn API**: For publishing to LinkedIn
- **Facebook Graph API**: For Facebook and Instagram content publishing
- **Pinterest API**: For Pinterest pin creation
- **Buffer/Hootsuite API (Optional)**: For integration with existing social media tools

### Development Tools
- **Git**: Version control
- **npm/Yarn**: Package management
- **Jest**: Testing framework
- **ESLint/Prettier**: Code linting and formatting
- **Webpack**: Module bundling

## Technical Requirements

### Performance
- Content transformation processing should complete within 3 seconds
- UI should remain responsive during transformation operations
- System should handle blog posts up to 5000 words

### Security
- User authentication and authorization
- Secure storage of social media API credentials
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- CSRF protection

### Scalability
- Modular architecture to allow easy addition of new social platforms
- Separate transformation logic from platform-specific integrations
- Stateless design where possible to allow horizontal scaling

## Development Environment
- Local development server with hot reloading
- .env file for environment configuration
- Docker container for consistent development environment
- Automated testing setup

## Deployment
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- Containerized deployment for consistency across environments
- Environment-specific configuration management

## Technical Constraints
- Must comply with each platform's API rate limits and policies
- Social media platforms may change their APIs, requiring adaptive design
- Image processing may be resource-intensive and require optimization
- Different platforms have varying support for rich media content

## Dependencies
- Social media platform SDKs and API libraries
- Natural language processing tools for content analysis
- Image processing libraries for visual content optimization
- OAuth libraries for authentication flows

## Technical Roadmap
1. Core content transformation engine
2. Platform-specific adapters for major social networks
3. User interface for content input and preview
4. Authentication and user management
5. Scheduling and publishing functionality
6. Analytics and performance tracking
