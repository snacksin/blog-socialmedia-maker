# Project Intelligence (.clinerules)

## Code and Implementation Guidelines

- Project uses a component-based architecture for modularity and extensibility
- Platform-specific logic should be isolated in dedicated modules
- Maintain separation between content analysis and platform transformation

## User Preferences

- To be discovered as the project progresses

## Project-Specific Patterns

- Social media platforms follow distinct patterns:
  - Twitter/X: Character limits, hashtag importance, threading for longer content
  - LinkedIn: Professional tone, longer-form content, industry-specific hashtags
  - Instagram: Visual focus with supporting text, hashtag blocks
  - Facebook: Mixed media, varied lengths, engagement-focused
  - Pinterest: Visual with strong CTA, linked to source

## Known Challenges

- Social media APIs frequently change policies and endpoints
- Different platforms require different authentication flows
- Content optimization varies significantly between platforms
- Image formatting requirements differ across platforms

## Workflow Patterns

- Incremental development with focus on one platform integration at a time
- Test-driven development for transformation algorithms
- Regular user feedback to validate transformation quality

## Tool Usage

- Document all API rate limits and restrictions
- Use staging environments for testing platform integrations
- Establish local test data for consistent development

*This document captures learned patterns and intelligence specific to this project. It will grow over time as we discover new insights through implementation and testing.*
